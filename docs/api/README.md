# REAR API

This chapter details all the REAR messages, the purpose of then and the message body. Specifically, we can distinguish the messages in required and optional:
 * Required (Figure 1 details an example of possible interaction between client and provider using the required messages)
   * **List flavors**, sent by the client to probe the available flavors offered by a given provider
   * **Reserve flavor**, sent by the client to perform a reservation on a specific flavor
   * **Confirm reservation**, sent by the client to complete the purchase of an offered flavor
 * Optional
   * **Refresh**, sent by the provider to refresh a particular flavor. By sending a refresh message, the provider helps maintain the availability of flavors and allows the consumer to effectively manage and allocate resources based on the updated expiration time.
   * **Withdrawal**, sent by the provider to the consumer to notify that a specific flavor is no longer available. This message serves as a notification mechanism to inform the consumer that the requested flavor is no longer available.

Note that the sequence of messages between the client and the provider is fixed, as well as the order. This is because each step requires a set of information returned from the previous step(s).

Moreover, there is a huge difference in the communication pattern between required and optional messages. Indeed, required messages follow a client/server approach, i.e., with the client always initiating the communication, whereas the optional messages are sent asynchronously by the server towards the clients. Such design choice greatly improves the expressiveness of the protocol, but it calls for different architectural style for the communication (e.g., REST, Websocket, â€¦), as the different types of messages have different requirements. Appendix A details the communication patterns that are REAR-compatible. 

## Required messages
This section details the required messages in the REAR protocol for resource advertisement and reservation.

### List Flavours
